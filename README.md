Viz: A Web-Application for Graph Algorithm Visualisation

A usability focused algorithm visualizer web application developed in JavaScript.

Firebase configuration files are used for hosting on the Firebase hosting service at the URL: https://viz-diss.web.app/

The index.html file in the public folder can be hosted on localhost to use the application without Firebase or the link. The easiest way to achieve this is with the Live Server extension for VS Code. Alternatively you can simply drag the index.html file into a browser and it will open and work as intended.
